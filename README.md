# 🚴‍♂️ Mountain Bike Sales & Profit Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using a real-world Mountain Bike Sales dataset.  
The dataset was cleaned and transformed using **Python (Pandas)** in PyCharm, and an interactive dashboard was built in **Power BI** to generate meaningful business insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI
- Excel

## 🔄 Data Cleaning (Python)
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values  
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., Gender, Country)  
- Fixed invalid values in *Unit Cost* and *Unit Price*  
- Recalculated key metrics:  
  - **Cost = Order Quantity × Unit Cost**  
  - **Revenue = Order Quantity × Unit Price**  
  - **Profit = Revenue – Cost**  

## 📊 Dashboard (Power BI)
The interactive dashboard provides insights on:
- Total Revenue, Total Profit, Number of Orders, Average Quantity  
- Orders segmented by Age Group and Gender  
- Profit contribution by Country and State  
- Daily Revenue trends

- The United States and Australia contributed the most to profit  
- Average order quantity ≈ **2.13 units per order**  

## ✅ Conclusion
This project showcases the **end-to-end process** of a Data Analyst:  
cleaning messy data with Python, validating business metrics, and building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to support data-driven decisions.
